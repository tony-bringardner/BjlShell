NAME
     ln – link files

SYNOPSIS
     ln [-L | -P | -s [-F]] [-f | -iw] [-hnv] source_file [target_file]
     ln [-L | -P | -s [-F]] [-f | -iw] [-hnv] source_file ... target_dir

DESCRIPTION
     The ln utility creates a new directory entry (linked file) for the file name specified by target_file.  The target_file will be created with the same file modes as the source_file.  It is
     useful for maintaining multiple copies of a file in many places at once without using up storage for the “copies”; instead, a link “points” to the original copy.  There are two types of links;
     hard links and symbolic links.  How a link “points” to a file is one of the differences between a hard and symbolic link.

     The options are as follows:

     -L    When creating a hard link to a symbolic link, create a hard link to the target of the symbolic link.  
     		This is the default.  This option cancels the -P option.

     -P    When creating a hard link to a symbolic link, create a hard link to the symbolic link itself.  
     		This option cancels the -L option.

     -f    If the target file already exists, then unlink it so that the link may occur.  
     		(The -f option overrides any previous -i and -w options.)

     -h    If the target_file or target_dir is a symbolic link, do not follow it.  
     		This is most useful with the -f option, to replace a symlink which may point to a directory.

     -i    Cause ln to write a prompt to standard error if the target file exists.  
     		If the response from the standard input begins with the character ‘y’ or ‘Y’, then unlink the target file so that
           	the link may occur.  Otherwise, do not attempt the link.  (The -i option overrides any previous -f options.)

     -s    Create a symbolic link.

     -v    Cause ln to be verbose, showing files as they are processed.


     By default, ln makes hard links.  A hard link to a file is indistinguishable from the original directory entry; 
     any changes to a file are effectively independent of the name used to reference the file.  
     Directories may not be hardlinked, and hard links may not span file systems.
