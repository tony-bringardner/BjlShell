NAME
     cp – copy files

SYNOPSIS
     cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-f | -i | -n] [-aclNpSsvXx] source_file target_file
     cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-f | -i | -n] [-aclNpSsvXx] source_file ... target_directory
     cp [-f | -i | -n] [-aclNPpSsvXx] source_file target_file
     cp [-f | -i | -n] [-aclNPpSsvXx] source_file ... target_directory

DESCRIPTION
     In the first synopsis form, the cp utility copies the contents of the source_file to the target_file.  
     In the second synopsis form, the contents of each named source_file is copied to the
     destination target_directory.  The names of the files themselves are not changed.  
     If cp detects an attempt to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.

     The following options are available:

     -H    If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.  
     		(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)

     -L    If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     -P    No symbolic links are followed.  This is the default if the -R option is specified.

     -R    If source_file designates a directory, cp copies the directory and the entire subtree connected at that point.  
     		If the source_file ends in a /, the contents of the directory are copied rather than the directory itself.  
     		This option also causes symbolic links to be copied, rather than indirected through, and for cp to create special 
     		files rather than copying them as normal files.  
     		Created directories have the same mode as the corresponding source directory, unmodified by the process' umask.

           	In -R mode, cp will continue copying even if errors are detected.

           	Note that cp copies hard linked files as separate files.  

     -a    Archive mode.  Same as -RpP.  Preserves structure and attributes of files but not directory structure.

     -f    For each existing destination pathname, remove it and create a new file, without prompting for confirmation 
     		regardless of its permissions.  (The -f option overrides any previous -i or -n options.)

           The target file is not unlinked before the copy.  Thus, any existing access rights will be retained.

     -i    Cause cp to write a prompt to the standard error output before copying a file that would overwrite an existing file.  
     		If the response from the standard input begins with the character ‘y’ or ‘Y’, the file copy is attempted.  
     		(The -i option overrides any previous -f or -n options.)

     -l    Create hard links to regular files in a hierarchy instead of copying.

     -N    When used with -p, suppress copying file flags.

     -n    Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any previous -f or -i options.)

     -p    Cause cp to preserve the following attributes of each source file in the copy: 
     		modification time, access time, file flags, file mode, user ID, and group ID, as allowed by permissions.

           	If the user ID and group ID cannot be preserved, no error message is displayed and the exit value is not altered.

           	
     -s    Create symbolic links to regular files in a hierarchy instead of copying.

     -v    Cause cp to be verbose, showing files as they are copied.

     -x    File system mount points are not traversed.

    For each destination file that already exists, its contents are overwritten if permissions allow.  
    Its mode, user ID, and group ID are unchanged unless the -p option was specified.

    In the second synopsis form, target_directory must exist unless there is only one named source_file 
    which is a directory and the -R flag is specified.

    If the destination file does not exist, the mode of the source file is used as modified by the file mode 
    creation mask (umask).  

    Appropriate permissions are required for file creation or overwriting.

    Symbolic links are always followed unless the -R flag is set, in which case symbolic links are not followed, by default.  
    The -H or -L flags (in conjunction with the -R flag) cause symbolic links to be followed as described above.  
    The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless the -R option is specified.  In addition, these options override each other 
    and the command's actions are determined by the last one specified.

  	If cp encounters an I/O error during the copy, then cp may leave a partially copied target_file in place.  
  	cp specifically avoids cleaning up the output file in error cases to avoid further data loss in cases where the 
  	source may not be recoverable.
